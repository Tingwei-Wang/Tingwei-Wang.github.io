# Welcome!

I am a graduate student in Management from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2021.09–2024.06), with a strong academic interest in **environmental economics**, **sustainable development policy**, and **data-driven policy evaluation**. I hold a B.A. in Economics from Dalian University of Technology.

My academic training and research assistantships have equipped me with solid foundations in **microeconomics**, **quantitative methods**, and **environmental governance frameworks**. I am proficient in Stata and have beginner experience in R and Python for applied policy analysis.

Currently, I am actively applying for PhD positions in **Environmental Economics**, and I hope to explore the intersection of economic policy and environmental sustainability.
